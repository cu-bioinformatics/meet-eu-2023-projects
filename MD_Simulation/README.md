# MD Simulation

The 6ZSL chain A PDB file was used for the setup of the MD Sim using GROMACS. The final ligand pose was extracted from "EOS100380.mae" using PyMol. Acpype was used to configure the ligand for the MD simulation. For the rest of the simulation the tutorial by Lemke was used, which can be found under http://www.mdtutorials.com/gmx/complex/index.html.
