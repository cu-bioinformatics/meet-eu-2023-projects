## Approach 
Creating a Graph Convolutional Network that aims to predict the docking score of inputs ligands on the targeted ATP binding site.
## Tools Used in Our Pipeline
Molecular Docking : AutoDock Vina
## Pipeline
- Preparation 
- Docking on Vina
- Create a dataset
- Train the model
- Evaluate the model
- Questionning the results
## How to use this repository

## General
 “Meet-EU” is an international team-based course organised by five 4EU+ member universities (Heidelberg, Milan, Paris, Prague, Warsaw) as part of the 4EU+ joint educational offer during the academic year 2023/2024. Meet-EU has been designed to promote interdisciplinary training through research and welcomes students from different disciplines, from computer science, physics and mathematics to chemistry, biology and biotechnologies. 

 Students are asked to address and solve a specific research problem under the supervision of tutors at each university. Students organize themselves in small groups of 4-5 students each. Each group works independently to propose a solution to the question. 

 ## Teams
 Each team has a separate branch placed within this repository.

## Team Pairing
At mid-course, a face-to-face meeting will be held, the activities completed by each group will be discussed and the groups will be paired to implement a joint second step of the project. Paired teams should be preferably belong to different countries. 

The teams are paired as follows:
| Pairs |
| :-: |
| Warsaw 4 - Paris 1 - Milano 1 |
| Heidelberg 1 - Warsaw 1 - Sorbonne 5 |
| Sorbonne 2 - Prag |
| Warsaw 3 - Milano 2 - Sorbone 4 |
| Warsaw 2 - Sorbone 3 - Sorbonne 6 |

## Troubleshooting
GitHub allows me to grant you the access to your repository branch only after you accept the invitation to the repository. Therefore, don't hesitate to reach me out through [raising an Issue](https://github.com/cu-bioinformatics/meet-eu-2023-projects/issues), if it would take me too much time. 

Also, you can use the [Issues](https://github.com/cu-bioinformatics/meet-eu-2023-projects/issues) for any other problem that might occur.
